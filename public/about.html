<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Shana Pandya is a highly lazy but enthusiastic person. 
    Born in 2004 to two amazing people on the planet with good values and morals. 
    She went to school in Ahmedabad. She is dumb. She is an idiot. 
    Shibum Kharadi is a friend she made in college. He had a friend named Yashli. 
    That's how she met Yashli. 
    Together they convinced her to take a web development course even though it was not in her caliber.
